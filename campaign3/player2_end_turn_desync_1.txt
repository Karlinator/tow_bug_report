WARNING: PanelOpenedCampaign event received for panel with name [unit_exchange], but this panel has not been added to the panels_blocking or panels_not_blocking list in lib_campaign_ui.lua. Please add it to one of these lists - the blocking list of panels blocks scripted interventions (i.e. prevents normal advice from proceeding), the not-blocking does not. If it dismisses or covers the main UI (e.g. tech, diplomacy) a record will need adding to the overrides list in lib_help_pages.lua too.
